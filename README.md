c_teatimer

I often find myself working in the command line, and have no desire to moeve
away what I'm working on just to monitor my tea. Hence the quick write-up of
this software. The time that the tea will steep is hardcoded, but considering
how small the software is you can easily change the time and recompile the
software.

It does nothing exciting, and there are no bells or whistles. When called it
simply tells you that the tea is steeping, and will display a message when the
tea is finished.

Usage:

_./c_teatimer&_
