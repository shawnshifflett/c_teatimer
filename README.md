c_teatimer

I often find myself working in the command line, and have no desire
to move away from what I'm working on just to monitor my tea. Hence
the quick write-up of this software. The time that the tea will steep
is hardcoded, but considering how small the software is you can easily
change the time and recompile the software.

It does nothing exciting, and there are no bells or whistles. When called
it simply tells you that the tea is steeping, sleeps for the coded amount
of time, and then displays a message when the tea is finished.

Usage:

_./c_teatimer&_
